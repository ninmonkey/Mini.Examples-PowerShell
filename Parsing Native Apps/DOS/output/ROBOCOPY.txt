::
:: Remarks :
::
       Using /PURGE or /MIR on the root directory of the volume formerly caused 
       robocopy to apply the requested operation on files inside the System 
       Volume Information directory as well. This is no longer the case; if 
       either is specified, robocopy will skip any files or directories with that 
       name in the top-level source and destination directories of the copy session.

       The modified files classification applies only when both source 
       and destination filesystems support change timestamps (e.g., NTFS) 
       and the source and destination files have different change times but are 
       otherwise the same. These files are not copied by default; specify /IM 
       to include them.

       The /DCOPY:E flag requests that extended attribute copying should be 
       attempted for directories. Note that currently robocopy will continue 
       if a directory's EAs could not be copied. This flag is also not included 
       in /COPYALL.

       Using /LFSM requests robocopy to operate in 'low free space mode'. 
       In that mode, robocopy will pause whenever a file copy would cause the 
       destination volume's free space to go below a 'floor' value, which 
       can be explicitly specified by the LFSM:n[KMG] form of the flag. 
       If /LFSM is specified with no explicit floor value, the floor is set to 
       ten percent of the destination volume's size. 
       Low free space mode is incompatible with /MT, /EFSRAW, /B, and /ZB.
